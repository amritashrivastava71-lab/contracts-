# Blockchain for Ethical Sourcing Verification

## 📘 Project Description
This project leverages blockchain technology to ensure **transparency and accountability** in the sourcing of materials and goods.  
It allows suppliers to register their details, update their ethical certification status, and enables anyone to verify their authenticity.

## 🎯 Project Vision
To create a decentralized and tamper-proof system that verifies whether suppliers and manufacturers are adhering to ethical sourcing practices, ensuring sustainability and fair trade across the supply chain.

## ⚙️ Key Features
- **Supplier Registration**: Suppliers can register with their details (name, location).
- **Certification Update**: Suppliers can mark themselves as ethically certified.
- **Transparency & Verification**: Any user can verify supplier authenticity and certification.
- **Blockchain-based Records**: Data is immutable and visible to all participants.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Integration with **IoT sensors** to automatically log raw material origins.  
- Implementation of **third-party certification authorities** for verification.  
- Development of a **frontend dashboard** for easy supplier management.  
- Use of **NFT-based certificates** for verified suppliers.  
- Expansion to multi-chain deployment (Ethereum, Polygon, Hyperledger).
